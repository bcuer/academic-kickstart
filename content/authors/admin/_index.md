# Biography

I am currently a PhD student under the supervision of Caroline Mollevi and [CÃ©lia Touraine](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Celia_Touraine) at the Montpellier Cancer Institute ([ICM](https://www.icm.unicancer.fr/en)), France. I am working on different statistical approaches for handling missing data in longitudinal analysis.

My research focuses actually on joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data with applications in clinical trials for the longitudinal analysis of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in oncology. More specifically, I am studying on the using of joint models including competing risks in presence of informative missing data.
